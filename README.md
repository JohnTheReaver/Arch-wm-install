# Arch wm install
***These two scripts when run will install wm, dmenu &amp; st on your system and configure the wm.***

After installing Arch linux to your system you can clone this repository and first execute *i*.
When the first script is done just type startx and then open up a new terminal using super + enter and execute *o*.
That will configure the rice correctly.
