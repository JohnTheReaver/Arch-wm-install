# Arch WM Installation

**Note:** These two scripts will install a window manager (WM), along with dmenu and st, on your system and configure the WM.

After installing Arch Linux on your system, you can clone this repository and follow these steps:

1. Execute the first script by running `./i`.
2. Once the first script finishes, type `startx` to start the X server.
3. Open a new terminal using the key combination `Super + Enter`.
4. Execute the second script by running `./o`. This will correctly configure the rice.
